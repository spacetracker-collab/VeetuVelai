** Origin **

These were product ideas that were developed by me 
in association with High Tech Group of a major firm.

** Why is this Public **

I was called to explain the reason why I chose to take 
this diagrams. The answer is : The company provided no drawing
and design software except PowerPoint which greatly stymied
my design instincts. This was before draw.io. Further, I had
exhausted the quota for Gliffy and Lucid Chart. At that time the 
CTO of the world's largest Data communication and routing firm
had discovered Prezi and had created a beautiful Audio and Video
Presentation on the "Internet of Everything". His presentation
enthusiasm was amazing. I subscribed to Prezi at 16000 Rs a year
which is 200 Dollars a year. I made these presentations by 
borrowing a few German templates and made the diagrams. I exported
the same to PowerPoint and sent the same as product
 ideas. So, I felt, I have a right to the sketches.

** Technologies **

The technologies used were Apple HomeKit and Philips
ALighting. A microsite was also built.
