# VeetuVelai

**What does VeetuVelai mean**

Veetu -> Home
Velai -> Work

It means HomeWork in Tamil.

**Origin**

These were product ideas that were developed by me in association with High Tech Group of a major firm.

**Why is this Public - The controversy**

I was called to explain the reason why I chose to take  these diagrams out of the firm. The answer was : The company provided no drawing and design software except PowerPoint which greatly stymied my design instincts under a demanding management. This was before draw.io. Further, I had exhausted the quota for Gliffy and Lucid Chart. At that time, the 
CTO of the Worlds largest Data communication and routing firm had discovered Prezi and had created a beautiful Audio and Video Presentation on the "Internet of Everything" by himself which he delivered with the enthusiasm of a 10 year old to a rapt audience, in which I was there.  I subscribed to Prezi at 16000 Rs a year which is 200 Dollars a year, for one year. I made these presentations by borrowing a few German templates and made the diagrams in Prezi. I exported the same to PowerPoint and sent the same as product ideas. So, I felt, I have a right to the sketches. I heard that no concrete progress has been made on these products, so I do not want to hoard them.

**Technologies**

The technologies used were Apple HomeKit and Philips Hue. A microsite was also built. A bill of material with more than 200 items including Ecobee was drawn. The customer experience center offered to give space. There was heavy investment to create a wow effect in the annual CES in 2015. A microsite was built with all the hardware as prototypes and lots of use cases. Home Assetz is about the lifecycle of the asset. Home Warranty is about cyber warranty, which was an upcoming space along with usage based insurance in those days.
